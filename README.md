# Kaggle Projects

This repository contains all my Kaggle competition entries, datasets, and exploratory data analysis projects.

## Structure

Each project is organized in its own directory with notebooks, scripts, and documentation.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows with bash
```

2. Install dependencies for each project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
